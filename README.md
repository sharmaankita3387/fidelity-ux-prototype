# FinPath: AI-Driven Investment Dashboard & Unified Strategy POC

### [Live Demo: Experience the Prototype](https://sharmaankita3387.github.io/fidelity-ux-prototype/)

---

## Executive Summary
**FinPath** is a high-fidelity digital application designed for **Fidelity Canada**. It serves as a Proof-of-Concept (POC) for a "Unified Wealth View," aggregating disparate account types (FHSA, TFSA, RRSP) into a single, AI-optimized fractional strategy. 

This project demonstrates the intersection of **FinTech logic**, **Behavioral AI**, and **Modern Frontend Architecture**, providing a seamless bridge between complex financial products and user-centric design.

## New & Core Features

### 1. AI Digital Concierge (Directed Dialogue System)
The latest update features an **Intelligent Chatbot** that guides users through the Fidelity ecosystem.
* **Contextual Greeting:** Greets users with a focus on wealth protection and insurance.
* **Directed Dialogue:** Uses a choice-based navigation system to reduce "user fatigue" and guide clients toward Tax-Efficiency or Wealth Insurance strategies.
* **Dynamic Response Engine:** Simulates real-time "thinking" and asynchronous message delivery to build user trust.

### 2. Unified Asset Aggregator (The "Master Strategy")
* **Fractional Aggregation:** Demonstrates a proprietary-style logic that views FHSA, TFSA, and RRSP balances as a single "Master Strategy" rather than isolated accounts.
* **Strategy Profiler:** A behavioral quiz that maps user risk levels to quantitative asset allocations (Equities, Bonds, Cash) using **Chart.js**.

### 3. Institutional-Grade Security & UX
* **Auth-Wall Gatekeeper:** Features a professional institutional login simulation to mimic secure partner access environments.
* **Persistent Theme Engine:** A sophisticated Dark/Light mode toggle that leverages the `localStorage` API for a consistent user experience across sessions.
* **Asynchronous UX:** Includes custom loading states and "Analyzing..." sequences to replicate backend data processing latency.
