# FinPath: Behavioral Classification & Investment Dashboard
### [Live Demo: View Project](https://sharmaankita3387.github.io/fidelity-ux-prototype/)

## Executive Summary
**FinPath** is a high-fidelity digital prototype designed to bridge the gap between user intent and financial strategy. Built as a **Digital Applications Development Proof-of-Concept (POC)**, this project demonstrates how behavioral data can be transformed into actionable investment insights through a structured classification model and dynamic data visualization.

## Technical Architecture & Key Features

### 1. Data-Driven Classification Model
Unlike basic static forms, this tool utilizes a **State-Driven Model** logic to categorize users.
* **Behavioral Analysis:** Evaluates user-selected financial goals and risk tolerance levels.
* **Logical Mapping:** Maps qualitative inputs to quantitative asset allocations (Equities, Bonds, Cash) using a modular data structure.

### 2. High-Impact Data Visualization
* **Chart.js Integration:** Implements real-time rendering of investment portfolios via interactive Doughnut charts.
* **Dynamic UI:** The dashboard updates instantly without page refreshes, providing a modern "Single Page Application" (SPA) feel.

### 3. Professional Engineering Standards
* **State Persistence:** Leverages the `localStorage` API to maintain user preferences (theme selection) and session data across browser refreshes.
* **Asynchronous UX:** Features simulated asynchronous processing (AI-analysis state) to mimic back-end API latency and enhance user trust.
* **Responsive Architecture:** Developed with a **Mobile-First** approach using CSS Grid and Flexbox for seamless cross-device compatibility.

## Tech Stack
* **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3 (Advanced Custom Variables & Media Queries), JavaScript (ES6+).
* **Libraries:** **jQuery** (DOM Manipulation), **Chart.js** (Data Visualization).
* **Architecture:** Modular JavaScript, CSS Grid/Flexbox.
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages.

## Strategic Alignment (Recruiter Highlights)
* **User Experience (UX):** Includes a professional **Dark Mode** toggle and accessibility-focused typography.
* **FinTech Logic:** Demonstrates an understanding of financial risk profiles (Conservative vs. Aggressive).
* **Error Handling:** Built-in fail-safes for data fetching and browser storage interactions to ensure a robust "Next-Gen" platform experience.
